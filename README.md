**Fork the above repository and implement the following:**

Create a web application that will display a bargraph of tasks that were completed per day. (See barchart.png)

If possible, use Angular CLI, a REST API and a dataSource of your choice (can be in-memory data).

We prefer you use TDD.  Please make sure your tests pass.
